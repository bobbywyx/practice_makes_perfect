# Practice Makes Perfect

## Description

This repository will contain some exercise or mid-size projects that I have done. Languages will include `C/C++`, `Python`, `Rust`, And so on. This file will be used as an index for readers to find what they want.

Also you may find something interesting or useful in this repo, feel free to use it.

If some of the project is large enough, or it is so useful and original, I will create a new repository for it.
